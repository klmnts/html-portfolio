    The Top 3 Anime TV Series of All Time

<p>(totally not subjective)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (The Irregular at Magic High School)</h3>
<p>
    Put it here at number one, obviously for its superior writing, character development, and animation, 
    not because I'm a big fan of the series for its sci-fi magic fantasy genre and its 
    incredible use of science concepts. Definitely also not for Miyuki, but for the rest of the cast who 
    are basically all trolls in the Light Novel (highly recommend).

<h3>86 (eighty-six)</h3>
<p>
    Rewatching a series is when you see all the flaws in the story and thus is the objective way to 
    judge a series. The second round of 86 was more touching than the second round of Angel Beats, 
    to give a measure of how epic this series is. Pew pew robots with less of the cringy politics and more feels.
    Epic uniform designs for the win.

<h3>The Misfit of Demon King Academy</h3>
<p>
    Placed third totally not for the title being similar to Mahouka's but because I wanted 
    a series that combines comedy, trashy isekai harem, and ultimate memes all around. Forget the 
    real comedy series such as Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan, One Punch Man, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou,
    or D-Frag. Forget the overmilked isekai harem genre which started with the non-isekai Sword Art Online.
    Forget the overrated Konosuba which tried to combine comedy with isekai. The Misfit
    of Demon Lord High School or whatever its called is just a running meme of an story so bad, it 
    has become highest-tier comedy. Ridiculous plot holes and plot twists, with surprisingly little "plot".
    No time for horny jail when you're just laughing all day long when you binge this thing.
